## Insurance Policy Management

### Problem Statement

An insurance company wants to build a backend REST API to manage customers and their insurance policies. The system should allow administrators to register customers, create policies, view policies, update policy details, and search policies based on different criteria.

You are required to implement a **Spring Boot REST API** following clean architecture and best practices such as:

* Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
* DTO-based request and response handling
* Mapper classes for entity–DTO conversion
* Request validation
* Global exception handling
* JPA relationship mapping
* Query methods and custom queries
* Pagination and sorting

Use **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **MySQL**.

---

## Domain Model

Design the following entities with appropriate **JPA annotations**.

### Customer

**Fields**

* id
* name
* email
* phoneNumber
* address

**Relationship**

* One customer can have multiple insurance policies.

---

### Policy

**Fields**

* id
* policyNumber
* policyType (Health, Life, Vehicle)
* premiumAmount
* coverageAmount
* startDate
* endDate
* status (ACTIVE, EXPIRED, CANCELLED)

**Relationship**

* Each policy belongs to one customer.

---

# Tasks

## Task 1: Entity & Relationship Mapping

Create the following entity classes:

* Customer
* Policy

Implement the relationship:

* `@OneToMany` → Customer to Policies
* `@ManyToOne` → Policy to Customer

---

## Task 2: DTO Design

Create separate DTO classes to avoid exposing entity objects.

### Request DTOs

* CustomerRequestDTO
* PolicyRequestDTO

Example fields in **PolicyRequestDTO**:

* policyNumber
* policyType
* premiumAmount
* coverageAmount
* startDate
* endDate
* customerId

---

### Response DTOs

* CustomerResponseDTO
* PolicyResponseDTO

**PolicyResponseDTO should include:**

* policy details
* nested customer information

---

## Task 3: Mapper Classes

Create mapper classes to convert between **Entity and DTO**.

Examples:

* CustomerMapper
* PolicyMapper

**Responsibilities**

* Convert **RequestDTO → Entity**
* Convert **Entity → ResponseDTO**

---

## Task 4: Repository Layer

Create Spring Data JPA repositories:

* CustomerRepository
* PolicyRepository

Implement query methods such as:

* Find policies by policy type
* Find policies by customer ID
* Find policies within a premium range

Example:

```
List<Policy> findByPolicyType(String policyType);
```

---

## Task 5: Custom Query

Write at least one **JPQL query** using `@Query`.

**Example requirement**

Retrieve all policies belonging to a customer email address.

---

## Task 6: Service Layer

Implement service classes containing business logic.

Example methods:

* createCustomer()
* createPolicy()
* getPolicyById()
* updatePolicy()
* cancelPolicy()
* getPoliciesByType()
* getPoliciesByPremiumRange()

---

## Task 7: REST Controllers

Expose REST endpoints for the system.

### Customer APIs

| Method | Endpoint            | Description             |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| POST   | /api/customers      | Register new customer   |
| GET    | /api/customers      | Retrieve all customers  |
| GET    | /api/customers/{id} | Retrieve customer by ID |

---

### Policy APIs

| Method | Endpoint           | Description           |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| POST   | /api/policies      | Create a new policy   |
| GET    | /api/policies      | Retrieve all policies |
| GET    | /api/policies/{id} | Retrieve policy by ID |
| PUT    | /api/policies/{id} | Update policy         |
| DELETE | /api/policies/{id} | Cancel policy         |

---

## Task 8: Filtering APIs

Implement the following filtering features.

### Filter by policy type

```
GET /api/policies/type/{type}
```

### Filter by premium range

```
GET /api/policies/premium?min=1000&max=5000
```

---

## Task 9: Pagination and Sorting

Implement pagination and sorting for retrieving policies.

Example API:

```
GET /api/policies?page=0&size=5&sortBy=premiumAmount&direction=asc
```

Use **Spring Data Pageable**.

---

## Task 10: Validation

Apply **Jakarta validation annotations** to validate incoming requests.

### Customer

* name → cannot be blank
* email → must be valid

### Policy

* policyNumber → cannot be blank
* premiumAmount → must be positive
* coverageAmount → must be positive
* startDate → cannot be null

---

## Task 11: Global Exception Handling

Implement a global exception handler using:

```
@ControllerAdvice
```

Handle the following exceptions:

* CustomerNotFoundException
* PolicyNotFoundException
* Validation errors

---

## Error Response Format

Each error response must include:

* timestamp
* HTTP status
* error message
* request path

Example:

```
{
 "timestamp": "2026-03-07T10:30:00",
 "status": 404,
 "error": "Policy not found",
 "path": "/api/policies/10"
}
```

---

## Expected Project Layers

Your project should follow this structure:

* controller
* service
* repository
* entity
* dto
* mapper
* exception
